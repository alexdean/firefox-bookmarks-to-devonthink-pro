## Import Firefox bookmarks to DevonThink Pro

  1. Export a bookmarks backup from Firefox as JSON.
  1. Run numbered scripts in order. Read individual files for more information
     on what they do.

## WARNING

This is alpha code. I've used it personally to import my collection of FF
bookmarks into DTP, and it accomplished exactly what I wanted.

I haven't extensively considered whether my use case is general or specific.
Please open an issue if you have any troubles and I'll be happy to help.

I **highly** recommend importing into a test/disposable DTP database at first,
in case there are any unforseen side effects.
